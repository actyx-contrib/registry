# Registry toolkit

Want to keep track of and work with all fish of a specific type? Meet the RegistryFish pattern.

## scalable, reuseable, composable, and maintainable

One thing that has come up quite a few times is the need to track all fish of a certain kind in someplace. You may have a fish representing a specific entity on your shop-floor. There are going to be many instances of this fish, one for each entity. Now, what if you wanted to show a list of all these entities somewhere?

The registry pattern will lead you to a data model that is **scalable**, **reuseable**, **composable**, and **maintainable**.

Read more about it in the [blog post](https://developer.actyx.com/blog/2021/04/22/registry-fishes).

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Registry toolkit is available as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@actyx-contrib/registry).

```shell
npm install @actyx-contrib/registry
```

## ðŸ“– Example / Micro tutorials

This library is made to reduce the code you write.

Using Callbacks:

```typescript
import { observeRegistry } from '@actyx-contrib/registry'
import { ChatRoomRegistryFish, ChatFish } from './fish/chatFish'
import { Pond } from '@actyx/pond'

const manifest = {
  appId: 'com.example.registry-example',
  displayName: 'Registry Example',
  version: '0.0.1',
}

Pond.default(manifest).then(pond => {
  observeRegistry(pond, MachineFish.registry, Object.keys, MachineFish.of, states =>
    console.log(states),
  )
})
```

using RxJS:

```typescript
import { observeRegistry$ } from '@actyx-contrib/registry'
import { ChatRoomRegistryFish, ChatFish } from './fish/chatFish'
import { RxPond } from '@actyx-contrib/rx-pond'

const manifest = {
  appId: 'com.example.registry-example',
  displayName: 'Registry Example',
  version: '0.0.1',
}

RxPond.default(manifest).then(rxPond => {
  observeRegistry$(pond, MachineFish.registry, Object.keys, MachineFish.of).subscribe(states =>
    console.log(states),
  )
})
```
